# 150108 iOS project [calculator]

Just iOS app for my dad

# Please note:
* Actually this app not real calculator.
* This app only can supply simple math problem.

# Why create this app?
* As my dad ask me: if any app only show math problem then he can calculate it, no need limit time or any other.
* I try found some math's apps, but he do not liked.
* So I just to create this sample app which he want any function.

# About app:
* The math method include: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* Include a sample sqlite database to resotre the time for calculte (it effected when click "新结果" button)
* The frame can adjust iphone and ipad as using constraint size.
* The database: sqlite + FMDB
* This app not in apple sotre, just for study (As no menoy.T_T)

# About me:
* My English is so so, sorry and thanks your reading.
* 由于也想提高一下英语水平，所以就选择英语来表达。

关于这个App，
* 单纯使用原生iOS界面和使用objective-c语言生成数学题目
* 另外也使用了内置sqlite数据库来存储，基本只包含了一些iOS的基础技术。
